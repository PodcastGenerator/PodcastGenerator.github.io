            <h3>Looking for translators and testers for Podcast Generator 3.2</h3>
            <i>Published on 2022-03-07 by Chris Charabaruk</i>

        <p>
            Podcast Generator 3.2 is feature complete and heading into testing before we create a final release.
            If you are running Podcast Generator 3.1 and are willing to try out the new version, please
            <a href="https://github.com/PodcastGenerator/PodcastGenerator/releases/tag/v3.2.0-beta">download beta 1</a>
            and <a href="https://podcastindex.social/@coldacid">contact me on PodcastIndex.social</a> so that I know
            that you are testing it.
        </p>

        <p>
            We are also looking for people to translate Podcast Generator into different languages.
            This involves both translating messages within Podcast Generator, but also reviewing existing translations
            in order to ensure that the translated messages are accurate.
            If you are fluent with German, Spanish, French, Polish, Estonian, Czech, Hebrew, or any other languages,
            please help out <a href="https://www.transifex.com/albertobeta/podcast-generator/32/">the translation
            project</a> by providing or verifying translations.
            I hope that we can have German, Spanish, French, and Polish languages fully translated for the final 3.2
            release, but other languages are also close to complete and would be great to get in our release.
