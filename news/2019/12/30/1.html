	<h3>Podcast Generator Version 3</h3>
	<i>Published on 2019-12-30 by Emil Engler</i>
	<p>
		It has been about 2 months when I started the work on Podcast Generator 3. I rewrote the entire codebase from scratch. The new version is backwards compatible with Podcast Generator 2.7 (except themes). This means you just overwrite the files on your web server and run the backwards compatibility wizard. After this you will see a beatiful Podcast Generator 3 installation with all your episodes, categories, etc.<br>
		If you can speak a language that is not english your help is most welcome with <a href="https://www.transifex.com/albertobeta/podcast-generator/dashboard/">translating</a> the project. If you can code you can also submit a PR request via our <a href="https://github.com/albertobeta/PodcastGenerator/">GitHub</a>. If you want a feature or just want to report a bug, feel free to open a ticket at <a href="https://github.com/albertobeta/PodcastGenerator/issues">GitHub</a>.
