        <p>
            About 1 month ago I released PG 3. Lots of bugs were reported which I am really thankful for. However as
            questions repeated on GitHub a new release was required.<br>
            PG 3.0.1 is mostly made out of bug fixes and very minor new features. Also big thanks to C. Michael Pilato
            for his contributions.<br>
            You can read the full change logs + get the new version
            <a href="https://github.com/albertobeta/PodcastGenerator/releases/tag/v3.0.1">here</a>.<br>
            <br>
            Have a nice weekend and happy podcasting.<br>
            <br>
            Cheers,<br>
